## 🏗️ Production Workflow

To transition this project from development to production, follow these two steps:

### 1. Build the Project
This command compiles the source code into optimized static assets and server-side code. It creates a `.next` folder containing the production-ready application.

```bash
npm run build

```bash
npm run start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
